# Notebook LLM UI

The LLM UI is a web application that allows users to interact with the LLM model. The `.ipynb` notebook files provided in the repository can be used to setup LLM UI on online notebooks. The UI can be used to generate text from the LLM model and to fine-tune the model on custom datasets.

## Setup

1. Run all cells.
2. You will get a link to the UI on the last cell. Click on the link to open the UI.
